The first portfolio for Code institute 

The website covers an interesting topic of the French catacombs.
They are centuries old and not completely explored, they hold many secrets both scary and fun.
Check them out on my first portfolio project.

Its also contains a gallery page that has no text, but as they say a picture is worth a 1000 words

We also have a sign up page, its not real btw, but it mimics the sites ability to schedule a tourist visit online 
And to buy tickets and then have a pro guide thru the catacombs
