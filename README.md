**The first portfolio for Code institute.**

The first portfolio for Code Institute The website covers an interesting topic about the French catacombs. They are centuries old and not completely explored. They hold many secrets, both scary and fun. Check them out on my first portfolio project.
<h2>Main look across multiple screens.</h2>

It has a detailed home page with pictures and text that capture the main theme of the catacombs. It has details of how it was created and how it was used, as well as how it is used now as a tourist attraction.

<h2>The hero section with a landing image.</h2>

It also contains a gallery page that has no text, but as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words.

We also have a sign up page. It's not real, by the way, but it mimics the sites' ability to schedule a tourist visit online and to buy tickets and then have a pro guide through the catacombs.

<h2>Footer.</h2>

Finally, there is a footer at the bottom of each page with links to many media pages of the catacombs, all of which are real and functional; you can check them out and say hello to the content creators who also liked this subject!

<h3>Unfixed warnings</h3>
Warinings in HTML validator are linked to the site layout itself, some headings are not included because of the sites needs.
They are left as warings, but Bugs are not present in the code.
