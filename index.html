                <p>Under the city of light lies the maze of darkness, a tourist attraction, burial ground, mine, refuge for revolutionaries, and even a wartime tunnel system for troops of different factions. The catacombs are all of these things and more, depending on who you ask! Even though the main attraction is 2 km long and open to the public, the actual tunnel system runs 320 km long underneath Paris. Read about the history of the making of these scary yet fascinating catacombs, the reasons behind them, and the modern approach of tourists and law-breaking explorers alike. </p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <div class="textwall" id="text-history">
            <p>
                The tunnel system began when limestone was mined for the construction of Paris. This began quite some time ago, dating back to the Roman empire, and continued to medieval times, when it was more convenient for workers to mine underneath the city than transport stone from afar. Now, what could go wrong with digging holes in the earth that holds your city? The church of Notre Dame was built from these very stones and much of Paris, until in December 1774, a collapse occurred under the Avenue Denfert-Rochereau, destroying housing and swallowing people. More incidents occurred over the coming years until King Louis XVI took action and hired architect Charles Axel Guillaumot to find a solution to this problem. To better understand the origin of the millions of bones located in the catacombs, we must mention Les Innocents cemetery. It was common practice to bury remains in this central cemetery. Even despite a royal decree banning all city burials in 1763, the church opposed this and continued the practice that began in the 10th century. Hundreds of years later, a morbid incident occurred. During heavy rain in 1780, walls holding the now overflowing remains collapsed, an avalanche of corpses and sludge seeped across the neighborhood, so now the problem was at everyone’s doorstep. Back to the architect: he had already examined the tunnel system and connected some separated instances; now the idea was born to exhume millions of the dead and fill the tunnels, thus creating the catacombs we know today.

        <h1>Scary facts</h1>
        <div class="textwall" id="text-facts">
            <p>
                The Paris catacombs are over 300 km long, they run under buildings and belong to the respective owner of the land above.
                <br><br>
                People have been reported missing and have gone lost in the past, some have met their end there,
like a janitor of the Val-de-Grace hospital Philbert Aspairt, who was found years later and recognized by his keys. He was buried in the catacombs later.
                <br><br>
                Legends say that the voices of the countless dead call you and make you dwell deeper in the tunnels, inevitably loosing your way and meeting your demise.
                <br><br>
                There are reports of many satanic and cult like activities in the hidden parts of the cave system, many animal bones have been found over the years.
                <br><br>
                The modern illegal activities include underground cinema, bars and even parties and raves, there are certain individuals illegally exploring the caves and of course using them for various gains.
